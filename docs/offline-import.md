# Moving a dictionary between instances offline

The dictionary import normally downloads the published dataset from HuggingFace. Installations
without internet access — corporate networks, air-gapped labs, CI — and admins who edited an
exported dataset can load the same files from a local source instead (issue #269):

- **files uploaded through the admin UI** — the zip that _Export dictionary_ produces (the
  _Archive_ tab), or the dataset files in their own slots with the manifest either as a file or
  typed by hand (the _Separate files_ tab);
- **a directory or zip on the server** — inside the folder named by `DICTIONARY_IMPORT_DIR`
  (a mounted volume, for instance).

Both go through the same import pipeline as the HuggingFace source; only the download stage is
skipped.

## Dataset format

A dataset is the set of files the export writes, flat or inside a single wrapper folder:

```
manifest.json
vocab-bloom-hub-en-words.jsonl
vocab-bloom-hub-en-phrasal-verbs.jsonl
vocab-bloom-hub-en-grammar-patterns.jsonl
vocab-bloom-hub-en-phrases.jsonl
vocab-bloom-hub-en-meanings.jsonl
vocab-bloom-hub-en-meaning-translations.<lang>.jsonl   # one per language: .ru, .es, .fr, .de, .pt
vocab-bloom-hub-en-short-translations.<lang>.jsonl
```

The entry files (`words`, `phrases`, `grammar-patterns`) carry the entries themselves and their
forms; `phrasal-verbs` is the linking map of base verbs to their phrasal variants. The
collections are files of their own (issue #442), one line per row next to the key of its parent:

| File                          | One line per                  | Key of the parent                                               |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `meanings`                    | meaning (with its links)      | `word`, `part_of_speech`                                        |
| `meaning-translations.<lang>` | translation of a meaning      | `word`, `part_of_speech`, `meaning_sort_order`, `meaning_title` |
| `short-translations.<lang>`   | short translation of an entry | `word`, `part_of_speech`                                        |

The translations are one file per language (`<lang>` is a member of `available_languages`), so a
file stays a manageable size and a language loads on its own; a language without rows has no
file. Exports made before this split wrote one combined `meaning-translations.jsonl` /
`short-translations.jsonl` for every language — the import still reads those.

Phrases and grammar patterns are keyed the same way, with `phrase` / `grammar_pattern` as the
part of speech. The lines follow the order of the entry files, then the natural keys of the rows,
so two exports of the same data are byte-identical. Datasets published before this layout nest
`meanings` and `short_translations` inside the entry lines; the import still reads them.

Only the `.jsonl` files you actually have are needed — at least one of them; every file but the
words file is optional, and so is `manifest.json`. The collection files are imported after the
entry files and go to the entries and meanings that exist by then, whether they came from this
dataset or were there before: a file of translations alone — one language, say — loads into a
dictionary that already holds the entries, and rows the dictionary already has (a meaning with the
same sort order and title, a translation in the same language with the same title, a short
translation in the same language with the same description) are skipped like duplicate entries.
When the manifest is present
its `version` is stored as _Your version_ after the import (and its synonym / antonym link counts
refine the progress bar); without it the version stays unknown. The `license` and `attribution`
fields an export writes into the manifest ([`DATA_LICENSE.md`](../DATA_LICENSE.md)) are carried
along and not checked. Line counts for the progress bar
are always taken from the files themselves, so a hand-assembled dataset needs no bookkeeping.

The dataset is validated **before** the import starts and is rejected (`dataset_invalid`) when
there is no `.jsonl` file at all, when `manifest.json` is malformed, or when the folder / archive
contains any file with an unknown name. OS artefacts (`.DS_Store`, `__MACOSX/`) are ignored.

## Export on A → copy → import on B

1. On instance A open _Managing → Export dictionary_ (or call `GET /api/en/dictionary/export`
   and download the archive from `GET /api/en/dictionary/export/download/:exportId`). You get
   `vocab-bloom-hub-en-export.zip`.
2. Copy the zip to a machine that can reach instance B.
3. On instance B open _Managing → Import dictionary → Archive_, drop the zip into the upload
   area and press _Start importing_. The progress stream is the same as for the HuggingFace
   import; the manifest version is stored as _Your version_ when the import completes.

   To load the files separately open the _Separate files_ tab instead: one slot per file (the
   slot decides what the file is, its own name does not matter), and the manifest either as
   `manifest.json` or filled in by hand (version, optional synonym / antonym link counts).

Equivalent API calls (the admin cookie or a Bearer token is required). The multipart fields are
`archive` for the whole zip, or `words`, `phrasal_verbs`, `grammar_patterns`, `phrases`,
`meanings`, `meaning_translations_<lang>`, `short_translations_<lang>` (one slot per language, e.g.
`short_translations_es`) and `manifest` for the separate files;
the text fields `version`, `synonym_links` and `antonym_links` stand in for (and override) a
manifest file:

```bash
# the whole archive
curl -N -b cookies.txt -F archive=@vocab-bloom-hub-en-export.zip \
  http://localhost:3010/api/en/dictionary/import/upload

# only the words, the version typed by hand
curl -N -b cookies.txt -F words=@my-words.jsonl -F version=1.4.0 \
  http://localhost:3010/api/en/dictionary/import/upload

# translations only, for entries the dictionary already has
curl -N -b cookies.txt -F short_translations_es=@es-short-translations.jsonl \
  -F meaning_translations_es=@es-meaning-translations.jsonl \
  http://localhost:3010/api/en/dictionary/import/upload
```

Each upload is limited to 512 MiB; the uploaded files are deleted from the server once the
import has finished, whether or not it succeeded.

## Datasets on the server (`DICTIONARY_IMPORT_DIR`)

When the zip is already on the server — mounted into a container, copied by a deploy script —
point `DICTIONARY_IMPORT_DIR` at the folder holding it:

```dotenv
DICTIONARY_IMPORT_DIR=/data/dictionary-imports
```

The _From file_ tab then lists what the folder offers (zip archives and sub-folders containing a
`manifest.json`, one level deep), and the request names the pick relative to that folder:

```bash
curl -N -b cookies.txt -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"source":{"kind":"file","path":"vocab-bloom-hub-en-export.zip"}}' \
  http://localhost:3010/api/en/dictionary/import
```

Paths are resolved inside the import directory only: `..`, absolute paths and symlinks pointing
elsewhere are rejected (`dataset_file_not_found`). Without the variable the request fails with
`import_dir_not_configured` and the UI offers uploads only. The server never modifies or deletes
the files in that folder.

`GET /api/en/dictionary/import/sources` returns the same listing the UI shows:

```json
{
  "import_dir_configured": true,
  "files": [{ "path": "vocab-bloom-hub-en-export.zip", "kind": "zip", "size": 12345678 }]
}
```

## Notes

- Importing does not wipe the database first: records that already exist (same word, part of
  speech and form) are skipped, the same way the HuggingFace import behaves. To replace
  existing entries with the dataset content (keeping the entries you edited), run the import in
  update mode — see [operations.md](./operations.md#dataset-updates-vs-code-updates)
  (issue #328).
- With Docker Compose, mount the folder into the server container and set the variable to the
  mount point, e.g. `- ./imports:/data/dictionary-imports` and
  `DICTIONARY_IMPORT_DIR=/data/dictionary-imports`.
- `pg_dump` / `pg_restore` remain the right tool for moving a **whole database** including ids;
  the dataset route is for the dictionary content in its portable, diffable form.
