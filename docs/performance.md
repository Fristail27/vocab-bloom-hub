# Read performance on the full dictionary

How the API behaves on the real data volume (issue #279) — ~298k `en_entries`, ~327k
`en_words`, ~161k `en_meanings`, ~161k meaning translations, ~115k short translations, ~509k
synonym and ~183k antonym links — what
was done about it, and how to measure it again.

## Targets and where things stand

| Read (public API)                                  | Target (p95) | Postgres now | Note                                              |
| -------------------------------------------------- | -----------: | -----------: | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Headword / id lookup (`/words/{word}`, `/id/{id}`) |        20 ms |       ≤ 7 ms | one query per relation, rows assembled by hand    |
| Filtered list page (`/words?…`)                    |        20 ms |       ≤ 5 ms | index walk in `(word, id)` order, keyset cursor   |
| Random entry (`/random?…`)                         |        20 ms |       ≤ 7 ms | primary-key pivot, no `ORDER BY random()`         |
| Search, exact / prefix tiers (`/search`)           |        20 ms |       ≤ 8 ms | byte-order index on the headword                  |
| Search, substring / suffix tiers                   |        20 ms |       ≤ 8 ms | trigram GIN index (#278)                          |
| Search, typo (fuzzy tier)                          |        20 ms |      ≤ 10 ms | `pg_trgm` similarity when nothing else matches    |
| Search, 1–2 character term (short-term flow)       |        20 ms |       ≤ 6 ms | exact and prefix tiers only, index lookups (#292) |
| List page with meanings joined (`with_meanings`)   |        50 ms |      ≤ 13 ms | 8 small queries instead of one exploding join     |
| Batch lookup, 5 spellings (`/words/batch`, #397)   |        20 ms |       ≤ 5 ms | the same 9 statements as one headword             |
| Batch lookup, 50 spellings (the cap)               |       100 ms |      ≤ 25 ms | 9 statements, ~80 entries, no entity hydration    |

Numbers are p95 of the [benchmark](#the-benchmark) on a laptop against a local Postgres 18
with the published dataset; treat them as an order of magnitude, not a promise.

The full reads cost the same 9 statements whatever they return — the entries, then one
`IN (...)` per relation for the whole set — so a batch's time grows with the entries it
returns, not with the spellings: 50 everyday headwords are ~80 entries with ~240 meanings (a
285 KB answer) in ~22 ms. They used to take ~275 ms: the same statements, but `find()` with
relations then spent ~220 ms turning the rows into entity instances. Since issue #424
`WordRowsService` (`src/modules/EnModule/word-rows.service.ts`) runs the statements itself,
converts the raw values through the driver (the conversion hydration applies: booleans, enums,
arrays, JSON, dates) and groups the collections by foreign key in one pass; a unit test pins
its answer to `find()`'s field for field. The admin entry read, the detailed search and the
list with joins go through it too.

**SQLite is a development and test database only.** On the full dictionary its search tiers
take 0.1 – 1 s per request and the admin statistics 0.25 s (tables below): `LIKE` cannot use
its indexes, there is no `pg_trgm` (no fuzzy tier either) and the planner has no bitmap or parallel scans. The reads that became index
lookups after this work (headword / id lookups ~1 ms, random ~8 ms, list pages 10 – 30 ms)
are fine on SQLite too, so a full `dev.sqlite` stays usable for hacking on the API — but
nothing else. `NODE_ENV=production`
with a SQLite `DATABASE_URL` is a startup error, as before.

## What was slow and what changed

The [benchmark](#the-benchmark) with `--explain` found seven problems; each is fixed by a
change that the [query-plan guard](#the-query-plan-guard) keeps in place.

1. **Loading an entry multiplied its rows.** `find()` with nested relations joins everything
   in one statement, so a word with 4 forms × 4 meanings × 4 translations × 8 synonyms comes
   back as thousands of rows to deduplicate: 45 ms on Postgres and 2.2 s on SQLite for
   `GET /api/v1/words/run`. The reads that load the meaning tree now use
   `relationLoadStrategy: 'query'` — one query per relation (~20 small statements, each an
   index lookup) — 5 – 8 ms on Postgres, ~1 ms on SQLite. Every relation load uses it, even
   the light `word + forms` of a list page: joins would be ~1 ms cheaper on Postgres there,
   but SQLite materializes the whole `forms` table for that join (0.6 s per page), and a
   bounded handful of index lookups has no worst case to discover later.
2. **Prefix search could not use an index.** `entry.word LIKE 'xylo%'` under the `en_US`
   collation is a sequential scan of `en_entries`; a rare term ran every tier at full cost —
   490 ms. The prefix tiers (starts-with, phrase start) and the admin prefix filter now
   compare through `COLLATE "C"` (the `bytewise()` helper), served by `IDX_EN_ENTRY_WORD_C`:
   35 ms, the rest being the substring tiers — which #278 then moved onto a trigram index (below): 7 ms.
3. **The list had no index for its filters.** `?category=IT` scanned and sorted all of
   `en_words`: 244 ms. `AddWordFilterIndexes` adds a btree per filter column
   (`word_level`, `language_register`, `area_variant`, `form_of_word`), a GIN over the
   `categories` array (the filter uses the overlap operator `&&`, the only indexable form)
   and `IDX_EN_WORD_C` on `(word COLLATE "C", id)`, the order the list pages in. The list no
   longer joins `en_entries`: the same headword is on `en_words`, and the planner either
   walks `IDX_EN_WORD_C` (unselective filters) or bitmap-ANDs the filter indexes and top-N
   sorts (selective ones). 2 – 4 ms either way.
4. **The keyset cursor started the index walk from the beginning.** `word > :w OR (word = :w
AND id > :id)` is a filter, not a range start: a page at "m" read half the index (23 ms).
   The row comparison `(word, id) > (:w, :id)` is one index range condition: 0.1 ms
   (SQLite uses its `word` index for it too).
5. **The random draw scanned for its bounds.** `MIN(id)`/`MAX(id)` under the filters was a
   sequential scan (38 ms). The pivot is now drawn in the id range of the whole table (two
   primary-key lookups) and the first matching row at or after it is taken, wrapping around
   to the last one before it: 4 – 7 ms whatever the filter.

6. **Substring, suffix and word-boundary search tiers** (`%term`, `%term%`, `% term %`) were sequential scans of `en_entries` — a btree cannot serve them (issue #278). `AddEntryWordTrigramIndex` enables `pg_trgm` and adds `IDX_EN_ENTRY_WORD_TRGM`, a GIN over the trigrams of the headword: the same `LIKE`s now read the index (a rare term 35 → 7 ms, a phrase 38 → 5.5 ms), and a **fuzzy tier** answers typos through the similarity operator when no other tier matches (`recieve` → `relieve, retrieve, …` in 8 ms, `meta.fuzzy`, `similarity` per item — see `api.md`). Very short terms (`ab`) have no full trigram; #292 gives them their own flow (below).

7. **One- and two-character terms ran every tier.** `%a%` matches ~175k of 298k headwords, so
   the suffix, substring and phrase tiers answered an arbitrary slice of half the dictionary
   (on Postgres a scan cut short by the `LIMIT`, on SQLite ~0.7 s), and a term with no full
   trigram has nothing to look up in the GIN. Since #292 a term shorter than
   `SEARCH_MIN_SUBSTRING_LENGTH` (3) stops after the exact and prefix tiers — both index
   lookups — and answers `meta.short_term: true`; a blank term answers nothing without a
   query. `a` and `ab`: 5 – 6 ms, every statement an index lookup (the guard covers them).

Not changed, by design:

- **Admin listings** count their total with `COUNT(DISTINCT …)` over a join and page by
  offset: 20 – 45 ms, admin-only, not part of the public contract.
- **Statistics** are counts over whole tables by nature (50 ms, cached by the UI).
- **`Last-Modified`** (`ORDER BY updateAt DESC LIMIT 1` on five tables) is a sort without an
  index, run at most once a minute behind a cache (#274).

## The benchmark

```bash
yarn workspace server bench                     # DATABASE_URL from the root .env
yarn workspace server bench --iterations 100    # more samples (default 30 after 3 warm-up calls)
yarn workspace server bench --explain           # Postgres: EXPLAIN every statement, report Seq Scans
yarn workspace server bench --json out.json     # raw numbers
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:../../dev.sqlite yarn workspace server bench   # the same on SQLite (from apps/server)
```

`src/bench/run.ts` boots the real application on an ephemeral port and drives the scenarios
of `src/bench/scenarios.ts` through HTTP — every search tier, the headword / id lookups, the
batch lookup (5 spellings and the 50-spelling cap), the list at several selectivities and
cursor depths, the random draw, the meta endpoint and the admin listings. It reports p50 / p95 / max latency and, through a TypeORM logger attached
to the data source (`QueryRecorder`), **how many statements one request costs** — the N+1
audit in one column. `--explain` runs `EXPLAIN (FORMAT JSON)` on each recorded statement
with its parameters bound and prints the sequential scans over the large tables.

The scenarios need the loaded dictionary (they look up the verb _run_). Load it with the
import page or `docs/offline-import.md`.

## The query-plan guard

```bash
yarn workspace server test:postgres      # needs a postgres:// DATABASE_URL with the migrations applied
```

`test/query-plans.pg-spec.ts` runs the public scenarios with `SET enable_seqscan = off`
and explains every statement they issue: with sequential scans discouraged the planner
picks an index path whenever one exists, so a `Seq Scan` on `en_entries`, `en_words`,
`en_meanings` or the translation and link tables means **no index can serve that query** —
on the full dictionary and on the empty database of CI alike. The `postgres-only tests` job of
`check-pull-request` runs it against a fresh Postgres service after `migration:run`, so a
query change that loses its index fails the pull request. The only statements skipped on purpose are the `Last-Modified` lookups (see above); the same job runs the trigram search suite (`test/fuzzy-search.pg-spec.ts`).

## Indexes on the large tables

Beyond the primary keys and the foreign-key indexes TypeORM creates for relations:

| Table               | Index                                                                                                                            | Serves                                                                           |

| `en_words`          | `IDX_EN_WORD_C` on `(word COLLATE "C", id)`                                                                                      | list order and cursor                                                            |

| `en_words`          | `IDX_EN_CATEGORIES` GIN on `(categories)`                                                                                        | `?category=` (`categories && ARRAY[…]`)                                          |
| `en_words`          | `IDX_EN_WORD`, `IDX_EN_WORD_LOOKUP`, `IDX_EN_PART_OF_SPEECH`, `IDX_EN_BASE_FORM`, `IDX_EN_BASE_PHRASAL`, `IDX_EN_PHRASAL_SEARCH` | headword lookups, part of speech, forms and phrasal links                        |
| `en_meanings`       | `IDX_EN_MEANING_WORD`, `IDX_EN_MEANING_WORD_SORT`                                                                                | meanings of an entry                                                             |
| translations, links | `…_MEANING`, `…_WORD`, `…_LANGUAGE`, junction primary keys                                                                       | translations and synonym / antonym links of a meaning                            |

Indexes a decorator cannot express (`COLLATE "C"`, GIN) are declared on the entity with
`MANUALLY_MANAGED_INDEX` (`synchronize: false`) and created by their migration
(`AddEntryWordCollateCIndex`, `AddWordFilterIndexes`, `AddEntryWordTrigramIndex`); `migration:generate` leaves them alone.
SQLite gets the plain btrees through `synchronize` and needs nothing for the rest.

## Numbers

p50 before → after the changes above (the Postgres "after" includes the trigram index of #278 and the short-term flow of #292; the fuzzy and one-letter scenarios did not exist before), then p95 and max after; "queries" is the number of SQL statements one request issues. Postgres 18, 30 iterations; SQLite (better-sqlite3 on the same `dev.sqlite`, no trigram index), 10 – 20 iterations. Same laptop, same dataset.
